## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all steps provided before attending the Hands-on lab.

### Task 1: Create an Azure resource group using the Azure Portal

In this task, you will use the Azure Portal to create a new Azure Resource Group for this lab.

1. Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. On the top-left corner of the portal, select the menu icon to display the menu.

    ![The portal menu icon is displayed.](media/portal-menu-icon.png "Menu icon")

3. In the left-hand menu, select **Resource Groups**.

4. At the top of the screen select the **+ New** option to add a new resource group.

   ![Add Resource Group Menu](media/add-resource-group-menu.png 'Resource Group Menu')

5. Create a new resource group with the name **modernize-app**, ensuring that the proper subscription and region nearest you are selected. **Please note** that currently, the only regions available for deploying to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL Hyperscale (Citus) deployment option are East US, East US 2, West US 2, North Central US, Canada Central, Australia East, Southeast Asia, North Europe, UK South, and West Europe. It is therefore recommended that you choose one of these regions for your resource group and all created resources. Once you have chosen a location, select **Review + Create**.

   ![Create Resource Group](media/create-resource-group.png 'Resource Group')

6. On the Summary blade, select **Create** to provision your resource group.

### Task 2: Deploy Azure resources

The below ARM template deploys several Azure resources for the labs, including Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, storage accounts, Event Hubs, Stream Analytics, Key Vault, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Machine Learning, etc.

1. Deploy the workspace through the following Azure ARM template (select the button below):

    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2FMCW-Innovate-and-modernize-apps-with-Data-and-AI%2Fmain%2FHands-on%20lab%2Fsetup%2F%2Farm.json" target="_blank"><img src="https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton" /></a>

2. On the **Custom deployment** form fill in the fields described below.

   - **Subscription**: Select your desired subscription for the deployment.
   - **Resource group**: Select the resource group you previously created.
   - **Region**: The region where your Azure Synapse environment will be created.

        > **Important**: The `Region` field under 'Parameters' will list the Azure regions where Azure Synapse Analytics is available as of November 2020. This will help you find a region where the service is available without being limited to where the resource group is defined.

   - **Unique Suffix**: This unique suffix will be used naming resources that will created as part of your deployment, such as your initials followed by the current date in YYYYMMDD format (ex. `jdh20210615`). Make sure you follow correct Azure [Resource naming](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging#resource-naming) conventions.
   - **SQL Administrator Login Password**: Provide a strong password for the SQLPool that will be created as part of your deployment. [Visit here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/password-policy?view=sql-server-ver15#password-complexity) to read about password rules in place. Your password will be needed during the next steps. Make sure you have your password noted and secured.

   ![The form is configured as described.](media/synapse-arm-template.png "Deploy an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace")

3. Select the **Review + create** button, then **Create**. The provisioning of your deployment resources will take approximately 6 minutes.

    > **Note**: You may experience a deployment step failing in regards to Role Assignment. This error may safely be ignored.

### Task 3: Provision an Ubuntu Virtual Machine

In the hands-on lab, you will use an Ubuntu virtual machine to send sensor data.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), type in "virtual machines" in the top search menu and then select **Virtual machines** from the results.

    ![In the Services search result list, Virtual machines is selected.](media/azure-create-linux-vm-search.png 'Virtual machines')

2. Select **+ Add** on the Virtual machines page and then select the **Virtual machine** option.

3. In the **Basics** tab, complete the following:

   | Field                          | Value                                              |
   | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------         |
   | Subscription                   | _select the appropriate subscription_              |
   | Resource group                 | _select `modernize-app`_                           |
   | Virtual machine name           | _`modernize-app-vm`_                               |

   | Public inbound ports           | _select `Allow selected ports`_                    |
   | Select inbound ports           | _select `SSH (22)`_                                |

   ![The form fields are completed with the previously described settings.](media/azure-create-linux-vm-1.png 'Create a virtual machine')

4. Select **Review + create**. On the review screen, select **Create**.

5. A modal dialog will appear to generate a new key pair.  Select **Download private key and create resource**. This will create the SSH key, and you will download a file named modernize-app-vm_key.pem.

    ![Generate a new key pair.](media/azure-create-linux-vm-2.png 'Generate new key pair')

6. Copy this private key to a location on your drive, such as `C:\Temp`. The private key must be accessible only to the current user, with no permissions for other users or groups. To accomplish this in Windows, right-click on the key and select **Properties**. On the **Security** tab, select **Advanced**.

    ![Set private key permissions.](media/azure-create-linux-vm-3.png 'Set private key permissions')

7. In Advanced Security Settings, ensure that you are the owner. If not, select **Change** and change the owner to your account.

8. In Advanced Security Settings, select **Disable inheritance** and select **Remove all inherited permissions from this object.** on the ensuing modal dialog.

    ![Disable inheritance and remove inherited permissions.](media/azure-create-linux-vm-4.png 'Block Inheritance')

9. In the Permissions tab on Advanced Security Settings, **Remove** any entries other than your user account.

    ![Remove permission entries for all accounts other than your own.](media/azure-create-linux-vm-5.png 'Remove permission entries')

10. If there is not already an entry for your account, select **Add** to add a new permission. Select **Select a principal** to add your account and then select **Full control** to give full control of the permissions file to your account. Then select **OK** for each open dialog to complete these changes.

    ![Add permissions for your user account.](media/azure-create-linux-vm-6.png 'Add permissions')

11. After the deployment succeeds, select the **Go to resource** button.

12. In the **Settings** section on the menu, select **Connect** and then **SSH**.  This will provide instructions on how to connect to the VM, including the IP address you will use for the connection.

    ![The example command to connect to your VM is selected.](media/azure-create-linux-vm-7.png 'Connect')

13. If you are running Windows 10 version 1709 (Fall Creators Update) or later, Windows has a built-in `ssh` command. Run the following command to ensure that your SSH key is configured correctly. Be sure to change the private key location and IP address as needed.

    `ssh -i #FILE_LOCATION#\modernize-app-vm_key.pem iotuser@#VM_IP_ADDRESS#`

    > **Important:**  If you receive an error message which includes "WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!", please ensure that you have completed the above steps and set file permissions for the private key.

    > **Note:** If you are running a version of Windows which does not include built-in SSH support, you can use an [SSH client like PuTTY](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-azure-vm-technical-asset#connect-to-a-linux-based-vm) to connect to your virtual machine. If you are using Linux or MacOS, you should already have the `ssh` command installed. In that case, be sure to run `chmod 400 modernize-app-vm_key.pem` to set the file as read-only and accessible only to your user account before attempting to connect.

### Task 4: Download the Hands-On Lab Contents

1. Read through both steps of this task.  Once you have done that, scroll back to the top of this document and return to the top level of the repository.

    ![The link back to the top level of this workshop is selected.](media/github-top-level.png 'Microsoft Cloud Workshop')

2. Select **Code** and then select **Download ZIP** to download a compressed archive file contents. This includes files in the **Hands-on lab\Resources** folder which will be necessary for the hands-on lab.

    ![The Download ZIP option is selected.](media/github-download-zip.png 'Download ZIP of Code')

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
