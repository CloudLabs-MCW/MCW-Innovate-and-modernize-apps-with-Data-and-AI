# Innovate and Modernize Apps with Data and AI hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on-lab, you will build a cloud processing and machine learning solution for IoT data. We will begin by deploying a factory load simulator using Azure IoT Edge to write into Azure IoT Hub, following the recommendations in the [Azure IoT reference architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/iot).  The data in this simulator represents sensor data collected from a stamping press machine, which cuts, shapes, and imprints sheet metal.  **TODO: exercise 1 website and exercise 2 explanation**

Once we have data in Azure IoT Hub, we will use Azure Stream Analytics to aggregate and transform the data, including using the Anomaly Detection service built into Stream Analytics to observe and report on abnormal machine temperature readings.  Stream Analytics will then send data to three different data stores:  Azure Database for PostgreSQL Hyperscale, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.  The data in each source will serve different purposes, from driving analytical microservices to performing predictive maintenance to forming the basis for Power BI dashboards.

You will learn how to apply historical machine temperature and stamping pressure values in the creation of a machine learning model to identify potential issues which might require machine adjustment.  You will deploy this predictive maintenance model and generate predictions on simulated stamp press data.

## Overview

The Innovate and Modernize Apps with Data & AI hands-on lab is an exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using the supplied example that is based on Azure IoT Hub and other related Azure services. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.

## Exercise 1: Deploy a factory load simulator and website

Duration: 40 minutes

[Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/) is a Microsoft offering which provides secure and reliable communication between IoT devices and cloud services in Azure. The aim of this service is to provide bidirectional communication at scale. The core focus of many industrial companies is not on cloud computing; therefore, they do not necessarily have the personnel skilled to provide guidance and to stand up a reliable and scalable infrastructure for an IoT solution. It is imperative for these types of companies to enter the IoT space not only for the cost savings associated with remote monitoring, but also to improve safety for their workers and the environment.

Wide World Importers is one such company that could use a helping hand entering the IoT space.  They have an existing suite of sensors and on-premises data collection mechanisms at each factory but would like to centralize data in the cloud. To achieve this, we will stand up a IoT Hub and assist them with the process of integrating existing sensors with IoT Hub via [Azure IoT Edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/). A [predictable cost model](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/iot-hub/) also ensures that there are no financial surprises.
