# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

-   Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

-   Stimulates the participant's thinking.

-   Involves the participant in the learning process.

-   Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

-   Ensures individual participant accountability.

-   Ties it all together for the participant.

-   Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

-   Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

-   Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.

-   Effectively leads the feedback process.

## Whiteboard design session flow 

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

-   Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

-   Current customer infrastructure and architecture

-   Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

-   Determine your target customer audience.

-   Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

-   Design and diagram your solution.

-   Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

-   Present solution

-   Respond to customer objections

-   Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

-   Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

-   Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

-   Become familiar with all key points and activities.

-   Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

-   Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

-   Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

-   **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

-   **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

-   **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

# Innovate and Modernize Apps with Data and AI whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this whiteboard design session, you will work with a group to design a solution for ingesting and preparing manufacturing device sensor data, as well as detecting anomalies in sensor data and creating, training, and deploying a machine learning model which can predict when device maintenance will become necessary.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will have learned how to capture Internet of Things (IoT) device data with Azure IoT Hub, process device data with Azure Stream Analytics, apply the Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern with Azure Functions, build a predictive maintenance model using Azure Synapse Analytics Spark notebooks, deploy the model to an Azure Machine Learning model registry, deploy the model to an Azure Container Instance, and generate predictions with Azure Functions accessing a Cosmos DB change feed.  These skills will help you modernize applications and integrate Artificial Intelligence into the application.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study 

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions:  With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1.  Meet your table participants and trainer.

2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

\[insert your custom workshop content here . . . \]


### Customer needs 

1. We want to centralize our factory sensor data into the cloud, using PaaS services wherever possible.

2. We want to replace our local installations of Apache Kafka with a service which does not require on-premises administrators.  Not all of our factories have dedicated Kafka administrators, and this has led to avoidable data loss issues in the past.

3. In addition, the consumer group application we have built to process data from Kafka is our data pipeline bottleneck--when factory managers need to wait for information to come in, it typically is because the consumer group has fallen behind again.  We want a system which can keep up with the torrent of device data our sensors generate.

4. Our factories are spread out across the world and factory managers are used to near-real-time responses from the web applications hosted on on-premises servers.  Instead of a pure cloud solution, we would like a hybrid cloud solution which allows our central office, located in Seattle, Washington, to oversee operations while still enabling factory managers to get the information they need at the speed to which they are accustomed.

5. In addition to storing data in the cloud, we would like to integrate machine learning into our application processing, including detecting anomalies in sensor data and using sensor data to predict when device maintenance will be necessary.

6. We would like to reduce our reliance on a classic web application server for data processing and move toward a microservice approach.


### Customer objections 

1. We process a large amount of sensor data at each factory.  Will a cloud service be able to keep up with our data requirements?

2. Does Azure have any capabilities available to perform anomaly detection on our sensor data?  How quickly could we get a service in place?

3. Will an hybrid Azure and on-premises solution require additional administrators?  We do not have the budget to hire new IT staff this fiscal year, and so we want to limit the amount of maintenance required.

4. How quickly could we add new sensors to this solution?  We have new manufacturing devices coming online and wish to expand the sensors on our existing devices, so we need a solution which will scale over time.

## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 60 minutes

**Business needs**

Directions: With all participants at your table, answer the following questions and list the answers on a flip chart:

1.  Who should you present this solution to? Who is your target customer audience? Who are the decision makers?

2.  What customer business needs do you need to address with your solution?

**Design**

Directions: With all participants at your table, respond to the following questions on a flip chart:

**Prepare**

Directions: With all participants at your table:

1.  Identify any customer needs that are not addressed with the proposed solution.

2.  Identify the benefits of your solution.

3.  Determine how you will respond to the customer's objections.

Prepare a 15-minute chalk-talk style presentation to the customer.

## Step 3: Present the solution

**Outcome**

Present a solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 30 minutes

**Presentation**

Directions:

1.  Pair with another table.

2.  One table is the Microsoft team and the other table is the customer.

3.  The Microsoft team presents their proposed solution to the customer.

4.  The customer makes one of the objections from the list of objections.

5.  The Microsoft team responds to the objection.

6.  The customer team gives feedback to the Microsoft team.

7.  Tables switch roles and repeat Steps 2-6.

##  Wrap-up 

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: Tables reconvene with the larger group to hear the facilitator/SME share the preferred solution for the case study.

-   Check in with your tables to ensure that they are transitioning from step to step on time.

-   Provide some feedback on their responses to the business needs and design.

    -   Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own.

-   Provide feedback for their responses to the customer's objections.

    -   Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own.

## Step 3: Present the solution

-   Determine which table will be paired with your table before Step 3 begins.

-   For the first round, assign one table as the presenting team and the other table as the customer.

-   Have the presenting team present their solution to the customer team.

    -   Have the customer team provide one objection for the presenting team to respond to.

    -   The presentation, objections, and feedback should take no longer than 15 minutes.

    -   If needed, the trainer may also provide feedback.

## Wrap-up

-   Have the table participants reconvene with the larger session group to hear the facilitator/SME share the following preferred solution.

## Preferred target audience

Molly Fischer, Chief Information Officer (CIO), Wide World Importers

The primary audience is business and technology decision-makers. From the case study scenario, it would include the Director of Analytics. Usually, we talk to the infrastructure managers who report to the chief information officer (CIO), or to application sponsors, such as a line of business (LOB) vice president (VP), chief marketing officer (CMO), or to those who represent the business unit IT or developers who report to application sponsors.
